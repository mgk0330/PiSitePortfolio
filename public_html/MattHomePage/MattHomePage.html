                Currently working for T. Rowe Price doing Change and 
                Incident management as well as Escalated Customer Support.  This involves ensuring internal and 
                external system stability by approving and front-lining change in the environment.  It also extends
                to assisting clients with technical issues and interfacing with support teams to provide a high quality
                of service.  I have also served as an assistant webmaster working on a project to update the

                Interests:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy hardware and software projects as a hobby at the enthusiast level.  Building and maintaining
                both Linux and Windows servers, as well as a high end Windows PC for video encoding and gaming.  On top
                of that I enjoy network infrastructure and maintain a complex personal network with multiple nodes.  
                I am getting into web hosting and website building and looking to run my own exchange server from a
                Raspberry Pi.  Please check out my hardware projects and code examples for more of what I do in my free 
                time.
